# TSP Solver 🔥  
A web-based solution to solve the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

🚀 Features  
✔️ Interactive UI to add cities and visualize paths.  
✔️ Implements a heuristic approach to find an optimized route.  
✔️ Uses JavaScript for dynamic calculations and pathfinding.  
✔️ Responsive design for smooth experience on different devices.  

📌 How It Works  
1️⃣ Add multiple cities by clicking on the map/grid.  
2️⃣ The algorithm calculates the shortest possible route.  
3️⃣ Visualize the computed path dynamically.  

🛠 Technologies Used  
- **HTML** for structure  
- **CSS** for styling  
- **JavaScript** for logic and calculations  

🎯 Future Enhancements  
🔹 Implement more efficient algorithms like Genetic Algorithm or Dynamic Programming.  
🔹 Allow users to upload CSV files with city coordinates.  
🔹 Add performance improvements for large datasets.
